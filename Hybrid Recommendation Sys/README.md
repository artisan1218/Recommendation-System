# Hybrid Recommendation Systems

Note: The Recommendation System will utilize the data from yelp.com
- business_avg.json
- user_avg.json
- user.json
- train_review.json – the main file that contains the review data, RS will primarily be working with this file. 
- test_review.json – containing only the target user and business pairs for prediction tasks
- test_review_ratings.json – containing the ground truth rating for the testing pairs
- The file is preprocessed first using Apache Spark
